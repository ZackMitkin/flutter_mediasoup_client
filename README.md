# flutter_mediasoup_client

Port of mediasoup client for flutter/dart.

I've started making my own port of flutter mediasoup client since the current available option just
seems abandoned and not possible to revive (not using null safety and doesn't have any base classes
implemented). https://github.com/flutter-webrtc/flutter-mediasoup-client

I've had experience working with mediasoup before, and found lots of interest in it. So thought I'd
take it upon myself to try this out.

## Status
- Setup base repository for porting over mediasoup-client v3
- Added RtpParameters, Producer, and Consumer classes

## TODO
- Add Device and Transport
- Setup example project for basic webrtc video call
- Work on Data Producer/Consumer

Pull requests are greatly appreciated!
